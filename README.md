# Metadata Editor Sample

This demo sample shows you how to integrate an external application which sets the metadata information for a Bulksign envelope.
This requires activating the metadata editor feature. Go to Settings \ Policies

and enable the redirect and set the url for the metadata editor. 

After this is setting is enabled, all drafts will be redirected to that url when sending the envelope.
